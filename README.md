# Language-Modeling
1. What is Language Modelling?
Language models like GPT-3 [7] have revolutionized modern deep learning applications for NLP, leading to widespread publicity and recognition. Interestingly, however, most of the technical novelty of GPT-3 was inherited from its predecessors GPT and GPT-2 [1, 2]. As such, a working understanding of GPT and GPT-2 is useful for gaining a better grasp of current approaches for NLP.
It can be defined as two parts- Pre-train a language model using a lot of raw textual data and Adapt this pre-trained model to solve a downstream tasks
